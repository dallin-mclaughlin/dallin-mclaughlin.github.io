        <h2>Simple Problems</h2>
        <p>
          In other languages failing to put in a semicolon (;). Those errors are annoying but at least the compiler tells you that something is not right at line __.
        </p>
        <h2>Elegantly Solving Problems</h2>
        <p>
          I guess these problems come down to the output not matching what you had in your mind. Sometimes its just a minus sign instead of a plus sign, or even accidentally including a line of code in a for loop when it should have been outside of it. They are terrible problems but simples because the code works but it just doesn't spit out the correct things! It gets quite frustrating especially when you spend a good hour trying to find the bug. I just used the print function to print out the value of the variables at different stages of the execution. I learned patience.

        <h2>Problem Solving Confidence</h2>
        <p>
          I'm very expert at using console.logging the varibles at different stages of the code execution. If I ever get really stuck I'll ask Google and then I'll just keep searching until I find some comment somewhere. I'm quite confident that all the problems I've come up against someone has already posted how they got around it on a forum site.
        </p>
        <h2>Getting Help Relunctance</h2>
        <p>
          Yeah there are seeds of like I don't want to look bad but then you have to realise that mostly everyone has had the some feelings and is probably more than willing to help out. Empathy seems to be universal thankfully.
