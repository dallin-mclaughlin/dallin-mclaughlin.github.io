        <h3>10 April 2023</h3>
        <h2>Long Term Goal</h2>
        <p>
          My long term goal is to get a software dev role either in web development or game development.
        </p>
        <h2>Strengths and Limitations</h2>
        <p>
          My strengths include a desire to learn and able to learn quickly. I just need to organise myself better. 
        </p>
        <h2>Skills to be developed</h2>
        <p>
          Better timemanagement. Learning how AI can be used with Web development.
        </p>
        <h2>Workload Management</h2>
        <p>
          During Bootcamp especially, make sure I have a list of objectives to complete before the day. When things start to get to me I'll just take a break and refresh my mind by reading a book or watching YouTube lol.
        </p>
        <h2>Asking for Help</h2>
        <p>
          At the start of the week use the group chat to post what I have done and a specific question that I have.
        </p>
        <h2>Facilitation Team Expectations</h2>
        <p>
          Just help when required for understanding code and languages. I'd love to hear experiences that you've had in the work force and what opportunities were available to you during your job.
        </p>
        <h2>Other Commitments</h2>
        <p>
          I don't have any commitments during the study time each day.
