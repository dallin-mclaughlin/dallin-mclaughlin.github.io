        <h1>My Values</h1>
        <h3>10 November 2010</h3>
        <h2>Ethical Decisions</h2>
        <p>
          I remember when I was a young child. I was shopping with my family and saw some candy. I stole it lol. I obviously thought that I could steal it without consequences. My parents found out and got me to return to the store and apologise for my misconduct. Police officers were actually there and told me that I need to make sure I made my bed everyday. I'm glad I learned that lesson young! 
        </p>
        <h2>Culture</h2>
        <p>
          I am a religious person. This has really expanded my view of the meaning of life. I was raised in a religious family but ultimately I had to choose whether I wanted this world view. I believe my religious values make me a better person and help me maintain positivity in my life.
        </p>
        <h2>Strengths</h2>
        <p>
          I can learn quickly. Actually I am already familiar with web development. This new learning will add onto what I've already learned and solidify it.
        </p>
        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <p>
          I need to make sure that I don't get distracted too much by going down rabbit holes because I want to continue learning. Sometimes I think that I need to use the time tracker to keep on task. I should use those tools more.
        </p>
        <h2>Working Productively</h2>
        <p>
          At university I worked well with students in study groups. In my math classes a group of us would get together to solve problems. That was fun and there were times when we disagreed but we learned to learn off each other.
