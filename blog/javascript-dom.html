        <h1>Javascript DOM</h1>
        <h3>24 April 2023</h3>
        <h2>The DOM</h2>
        <p>
          What is the DOM? DOM stands for document object model. It is the data representation of the objects of a document on the web. The objects in the document are able to be manipulated through languages such as Javascript. For example, when a webpage has been loaded javascript can run several commands like making a message pop up for the user to interact with.
        </p>
        <h2>HTML and CSS</h2>
        <p>
          HTML is the data within a DOM that represents the objects on the page. CSS is the data that deals with how the objects on the page are placed in layout. Manipulating the objects is possible by accessing the class name or id of objects in the DOM.
        </p>
        <h2>Loops</h2>
        <p>
          Loops are statements in code that iterate a code segment for a specified number of times or infinite numbers of times. Let's say you wanted to print out a list of names from a database. Best practise would say to create a loop has one print statement to print out all names instead of manually typing 300 lines of code to print 300 names. Infinite loops are useful for game development when you want visual frames to be rendered forever while the game runs. 
        </p>
        <h2>Control Flow</h2>
        <p>
          Control flow statements are statements that tell the interpreter to run a piece of code or not based on some previously defined value. So lets say you wanted to print out Hooray only if a value was equal to 0 then if the value was not 0 Hooray would not get printed out. Switch statements are another form of control flow statements.
        </p>
        <h2>Arrays and Objects</h2>
        <p>
          Arrays are data types that contain information that is indexed. Anything can be added to an array. It can then be accessed by the appropriate index number. Objects are information blocks that have datafields and methods that act in harmony with each other to organise code better. For example, an object could be a car that has datafields like Model, Year, and a function that prints out the model and year onto the console. 
        </p>
        <h2>Functions</h2>
        <p>
          Functions are pieces of code that help with code reuse. If any segment of code is repeated then the best way to deal with this is to encapsulate it within a function and then call the function when needed.
