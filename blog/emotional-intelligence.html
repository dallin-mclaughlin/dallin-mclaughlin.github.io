          <h2>EQ vs IQ</h2>
          <p>
            EQ is Emotional Intelligence. It explains a person's ability to perceive, control, evaluate and control emotions. IQ is Intelligence Quotient. It quantifies a person's overall mental ability

          <h2>Importance of Emotional Intelligence</h2>
          <p>
            In the past people have argued that IQ was the major determinant for success in life, but now many people are saying that emotional intelligence is another major determinant for success. People are trying to compete for your attention in the market place of ideas and consumer products so understanding human psychology and how to persuade and how you can be persuaded are good skills in life that will lead to success.

          <h2>Mindfulness</h2>
          <p>
            Mindfulness is becoming fully aware of the present. To not get so caught up in the past or future. Your body sensations and actions are focal points for learning how to be more mindfull.

          <h2>Conscious Listening</h2>
          <p>
            Listening was really fun. You really had to concentrate. I found it was hard to remember all the details of the conversation but as I began to recall more thoughts came to me.
