          <h2>Three New Things</h2>
          <p>
            (1) Human Skills are important for collaborative projects. If humans can't get along with and understand each other then group projects will be hard. (2) I do like to help people with their coding especially if they don't understand the material. (3) My ego? I need to continually want to learn new things in this type of work. Learning will never stop!
          </p>
          <h2>Values, Empathy, and Self-awareness</h2>
          <p>
            I guess if you were programming on your own you would want to make sure that you are working productively. These values would most definitely help with that. I feel like these values would help more in group work projects because you need to listen and understand what a person is saying.  
          </p>
          <h2>Core Learning</h2>
          <p>
            In the beginning I was asking why there was such a focus on it. Now I understand. I guess the core learning not only required learning but interacting with others. I think creating the plans for myself and reflecting about myself were the hardest things. I think devacademy spends a lot of time on core learning because this is what the software industry wants employees to have developed or learn. Personally I would want to focus on programming more because I want to learn more skills but as other people have said businesses can teach me the employee the skills but they can't teach someone how to listen effectively because work must begin.
