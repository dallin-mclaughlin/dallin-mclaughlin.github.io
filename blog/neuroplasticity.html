          <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>
          <h3>10 April 2023</h3>
          <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
          <p>
            This neural brain property allows your brain to be resilient and learn effectively. Our brains are constantly changing based on what we learn and what activities we want to make habits. If I have created a goal I think I need to realise that initially the progress towards that goal will be slow because my brain hasn't optimised its learning processes yet. However, with time, I can have confidence that the learning that I am doing will become natural for me instead of difficult. I think the best way to increase neuroplasticity is to look for already established learnings and then find ways to connect the new learnings with these already established learnings.
          <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
          <p>
            The Growth Mindset assumes that individuals are not just born smart they have the innate abilities or biological system to learn anything. Some people believe that because they have not understood certain concepts that they must be dumb. This is incorrect. The more correct view would be that we create fictional stories that have tried to explain why someone is smart or dumb and instead we should be all focusing on the fact that all human beings can learn to learn effectively through practice.

          <h2>Learning Plan</h2>
          <p>
            My learning plan can better reflect the idea of neuroplasticity by creating sub goals that work towards the ultimate goal. For example, if the goal is to run everymorning then perhaps the first week could be run once, then the second run twice, and so on until the goal is finally achieved.
